    <p>
      I moved to Philadelphia in early 2025. I didn't know the city well. I had visited once, briefly, and left with impressions of cheesesteaks and a surprisingly good art museum. Everything else I had to figure out by arriving.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a particular feeling that comes from being new to a place — a low-grade data-hunger. You're constantly collecting observations and trying to build a coherent model of how things work: which neighborhoods are walkable, which coffee shops are actually quiet in the morning, where the good running paths are. It's exploratory data analysis, except the dataset is your daily life.
    </p>

    <h2>The Routine-Building Phase</h2>
    <p>
      The first thing I did was establish anchors — fixed points in the week that gave structure before the rest filled in. A consistent grocery run. A regular run through Clark Park on Sunday mornings. A coffee shop close enough to walk to, good enough to want to. These aren't exciting discoveries, but they're load-bearing. Without them, new cities have a way of feeling formless.
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed something worth noting: the habits I managed to establish in the first three weeks became permanent. The ones I kept telling myself I'd start "once things settled" largely didn't happen. There's a small-sample lesson in there about the value of early signal — strong patterns established in noisy conditions tend to persist.
    </p>

    <h2>Finding Community Without a Campus</h2>
    <p>
      Moving for a job in your mid-twenties is different from moving for school. You don't arrive with a built-in cohort. There's no orientation week, no shared syllabus. The mechanisms of adult friendship — repeated proximity and low-stakes interaction over time — have to be constructed deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been more intentional about this than I expected to be. I joined a running group that meets on Saturday mornings. I've been to a few data community meetups. Neither of these is a silver bullet, but they're the closest adult equivalent of a class you see twice a week — regular, repeated contact with people who share at least one interest.
    </p>

    <h2>What Philadelphia Actually Is</h2>
    <p>
      Philadelphia is a walking city in a way I didn't expect. The grid makes navigation intuitive, and the neighborhoods are distinct enough to be interesting without being precious about it. It's also, quietly, a city that rewards noticing: the mural arts program means that a mundane block can have a remarkable wall. The farmers' markets are genuinely excellent. The transit is imperfect but functional.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm still building my model of this place. But the initial evidence is encouraging, and I'm learning to treat that as meaningful even in small sample sizes.
